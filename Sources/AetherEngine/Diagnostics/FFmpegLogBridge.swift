/// `EngineLog.handler` (in-app overlay, `aetherctl` stdout).
///
/// Without this bridge, FFmpeg writes to stderr via its default
/// callback, which is invisible to App Store builds, in-app overlays,
/// and `aetherctl`'s timestamped stdout. After install, every
/// `av_log(...)` call at or above the configured level is formatted
/// with `av_log_format_line2` (same prefix/format as ffmpeg's default
/// stderr output) and emitted under `.ffmpeg`.
///
/// The callback fires from whichever thread inside libav* did the
/// logging — demuxer workers, decoder threads, the muxer's interleave
/// queue. Safe because `EngineLog.emit` is itself thread-safe (OSLog
/// is, and any host handler is required to be by `EngineLog`'s
/// contract).

    ///     survives into Console.app.
